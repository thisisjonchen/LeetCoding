## Recursion
A method of of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems.

Laws of recursion:
    Must have a base case (to avoid stack overflow)
    Algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case
    Must call itself, recursively

Can be harmful if used incorrectly. (slower, more memory intesive than iterative)

Pros:
    Makes the code look clean and elegant
    Complex task can be broken down into simpler subproblems
    Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration

Cons:
    The logic behind recursion can be hard to follow through
    Can be expensive
    Can be hard to debug
